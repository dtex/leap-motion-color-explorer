leap-motion-color-explorer
==========================

A color explorer for the Leap Motion Controller. Not as practical as Kuler but fun.

If you have a Leap Motion Controller make sure it is clean, and "Allow Web Apps" is checked in your settings.

It's a little squirrely, especially when switching the number of compliments. 

Be sure to spread your fingers wide when your hand is open, and when you make a fist be sure it is tight.

In Firefox there are some artifacts that are a result of using % in the width and margins on the styles. Really need to redo this thing using flexbox.

I have not tested on Windows at all.

Please post problems to issues on the repo.
