leap-motion-color-explorer
==========================

A color explorer for the Leap Motion Controller. Not as practical as Kuler but fun.

If you have a Leap Motion Controller make sure it is clean, and "Allow Web Apps" is checked in your settings.

It's a little touchy re: the number of fingers you show. Be sure to spread them wide when your hand is open, and when you make a fist, be sure it is tight.
